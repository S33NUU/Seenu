                    rising frequency of cyber-attacks has forced businesses and government agencies to tighten their
                    defences against malicious hackers.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Cybersecurity is important because it protects all categories of data
                from theft and damage. This includes sensitive data, personally identifiable information (PII),
                protected health information (PHI), personal information, intellectual property, data, and governmental
                and industry information systems. Without a cybersecurity program, your organization cannot defend
                itself against data breach campaigns, which makes it an irresistible target for cybercriminals. </p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Scope of Ethical hacking in India</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Ethical hacking is generally used as penetration testing to detect
                vulnerabilities, risk and identify the loopholes in a security system and to take corrective measures
                against those attacks.

                Ethical hacking is a key component of risk evaluation, auditing, and counter-frauds. The scope for the
                Ethical Hackers is high and it is one of the rapidly growing careers at present as many malicious
                attackers cause a threat to the business and its networks. Industries like Information Technology and
                Banking Sectors hire several Ethical hackers to protect their data and infrastructure. Also, in the
                upcoming days, the demand for this profile is going to be high compared to other profiles due to an
                increased threat of vulnerabilities.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Skills Required to Become a Ethical Hacker</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"><strong>1. Computer Networking Skills</strong>
                One of the most important skills to become an ethical hacker is networking skills. The computer network
                is nothing but the interconnection of multiple devices, generally termed as Hosts connected using
                multiple paths to send/receive data or media. Understanding networks like DHCP, Suoernetting,
                Subnetting, and more will provide ethical hackers to explore the various interconnected computers in a
                network and the potential security threats that this might create, as well as how to handle those
                threats.
                <br><br><strong>2. Computer Skills</strong>
                Computer skills are knowledge and ability which allow one to use computers and related technology.
                Typically, basic computer skills include data processing, managing computer files, and creating
                presentations
                Linux is a community of open-source Unix like operating systems that are based on the Linux Kernel. It
                is a free and open-source operating system and the source code can be modified and distributed to anyone
                commercially or non commercially under the GNU General Public License</strong>
                <br><br><strong>3. Linux Skills</strong>
                Linux is a community of open-source Unix like operating systems that are based on the Linux Kernel. It
                is a free and open-source operating system and the source code can be modified and distributed to anyone
                commercially or non commercially under the GNU General Public License
                <br><br><strong>4. Programming Skills</strong>
                Another most important skill to become an ethical hacker is Programming Skills. So what does the word
                programming in the computer world actually means? It means, “The act of writing code understood by a
                computational device to perform various instructions.”
                <br><br><strong>5. Basic Hardware Knowledge</strong>
                Computer hardware comprises the physical parts of a computer, like the central processing unit (CPU),
                monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard,
                etc. By contrast, the software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware
                <br><br><strong>6. Reverse Engineering</strong>
                Reverse Engineering is a process of recovering the design, requirement specifications, and functions of
                a product from an analysis of its code.
